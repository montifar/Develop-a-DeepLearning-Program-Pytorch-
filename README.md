The code works by defining a simple neural network with two linear layers that process the input step-by-step. First, the input numbers are converted into a PyTorch tensor so the model can perform mathematical operations on them. The data is then passed through the first linear layer, which transforms the input using learned weights and biases. After this layer, the ReLU activation function is applied to remove negative values and help the model learn non-linear patterns. The output of ReLU is then passed into the second linear layer, producing the final prediction. During training, the model adjusts its weights by comparing its prediction to the true answer using a loss function. The optimizer updates the weights based on this loss, allowing the model to improve over time. After training, the model can take new input values and generate accurate predictions using what it learned.
